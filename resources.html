<h1>Resources</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>This are almost all the resources that I have used to learn web dev related topics, the order of these is the one that I would recommend someone just starting to learn. The first item, are some curriculums that I think are pretty good and would love to finish soon (between this year and the next one).</p>
<ol>
	<li>Curriculums / Complete Courses</li>

			<small>If you are going to buy one of the Udemy's courses I would recommend <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">The Web Developer Bootcamp</a> by Colt Steele, he is a great teacher and the course covers Full-Stack Web Development all with JavaScript, some of the topics are; HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, jQuery, node.js, express, etc</small>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<br>

	<li>How The Internet Works
		<ul>
			<li>Go to <a href="https://blog.petrovic.gr/2016/12/frontend-development-a-learning-guide/#How_internet_works">How the Internet works</a> section in Milan Petrovic guide, read the documents (they're not so long) and watch the videos (some of them are pretty good) and you should be good to go, but if you don't want to spend much time in this section just watch the Khan Academy course on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/code-org/internet-works">How the Internet Works</a> that include the "Father of the Internet" Vint Cerf
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<br>

	<li>GNU/Linux
		<ul>
			<li>
				If you don't have a mac or a linux based operatyng system like Ubuntu, then read this <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/installations">article</a> by The Odin Project about why you shouldn't use Windows for development (Of course you could write software in a Windows OS, but it is going to be harder) and what are the alternatives if you have this OS (install Ubuntu, use a virtual machine, etc).
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<br>

	<li>The Command Line
		<ul>
			<li>Do the <a href="">Command Line Basics</a> section in The Odin Project</li>
			<li>(optional) the Rithm School, have a course about the <a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/terminal">Terminal and UNIX</a> that is more advanced than The Odin Project resources tells that you should do</li>

	</li> -->
	<li>HTML/CSS
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Start with interactive tutorials, I would say to start with Codecademy's <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website">Make a Website</a> and then do <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web">HTML/CSS</a>, after that you could do Khan Academy <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Intro to HTML/CSS</a></p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>Other websites that are good to learn HTML and CSS are: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Shay Howe's <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">Learn to Code HTML and CSS</a> (I recommend doing this tutorial/guide and finishing it a 100%)</li>
					<li>HTML Dog's <a href="http://htmldog.com/guides/html/">HTML Tutorials</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/">Dive Into HTML5</a> by Mark Pilgrim (I haven't read this, but I have seen many recommendations on the internet, plus the illustrations seem really nice)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				If you like books, this are the ones that I've finished, in the order that I would recommend reading them:
				<ol>
					<li><a href="http://www.brianfran.co/wroteabook/">Illustrated Guide to Front-End Development</a> (paid: $15)</li>

			</li>
		</ul>

	</li>
	<br>

	<li>JavaScript
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Like HTML/CSS, I think that starting with interactive tutorials is a really good starting point; first, do Codecademy's <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript">Javascript</a> and then Khan Academy's <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Intro to JavaScript</a></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Some really good courses that I would recommend to anyone that wanted to have a really good base in JS are: </p>
				<ul>

					<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/">JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts</a> by Tony Alicea, which cost $15 in Udemy.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>And ultimately if you like books, you could read them in this recommended order: </p>
				<ol>
					<li><a href="http://jsforcats.com/">JS for Cats</a> (free)</li>

					<li><a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">You Don't Know JS</a>: This a collection of 6 books (which all of them are free) by Kyle Simpson that cover JavaScript. I've just read the first one of these books (<a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going">Up and Going</a>) and was really good from a begginer point of view.</li>
					<li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a>: This book is also free (available online) and it is written by Marijn Haverbeke. I haven't finished it (I've just read the first couples of chapters) and people say that this book is really good, but that it can get hard really fast if you are still a beginner.</li>
